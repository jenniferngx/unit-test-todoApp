# Project 

## Milestone 1: Test doubles

In this milestone of the project you are required to test a simple TODO-list management application that allows for searching by keyword, adding a todo, and completing all the todos for a user with a specific ID.

You are provided with a domain class `TODOApp.java` and two port classes `PersonRepository.java` and `TODORepository.java`. Each of the port classes abstracts a DAO (data access object) that links to a different table belonging to the same database for the app.

Your task for this milestone is to test the domain code in `TODOApp.java`. You may write your unit tests in `TODOAppTest.java` which was provided to you with additional information and hints.
